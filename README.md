# PYTHON-INTRODUCTION-SMOKING-PREVALENCE

## Overview

This repository contains the code and supporting materials for a group project completed as part of the course:

```
"Introduction to Data Analysis with Python"
```

The project focuses on analyzing smoking prevalence data using Python-based data analysis tools.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* data/
  Contains both raw and cleaned datasets used in the analysis.

* code/
  Contains the project code, organized into separate Jupyter notebooks for each task or analysis step.

* output/
  Stores figures, tables, and other outputs generated by running the code.

* requirements.txt
  Lists all Python packages required to run the project.

## Workflow Guide

Follow the steps below to set up the project and contribute safely.

1. Clone the Repository Locally

---

Open Git Bash (or another terminal) and run the following commands:

```
cd "your_working_directory"   # Change this to your desired directory
git clone <repository-url>     # Replace with the GitHub repository URL
cd Python-Introduction-Smoking-Prevalence
```

## 2. Check Git Status

Before making any changes, always check the repository status:

```
git status
```

If there are updates from other contributors, pull them to your local copy:

```
git pull
```

## 3. Set Up the Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment from the project root directory:

```
python -m venv myenv
```

This will create a new folder named `myenv` in the project directory.

4. Activate the Virtual Environment

---

Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command:

On Windows:

```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

## 5. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When new packages are added, update the requirements file by running:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## 6. Work on the Code

You can now begin working on the notebooks and scripts within the `code/` directory.

7. Deactivate the Virtual Environment

---

When you are finished working, deactivate the virtual environment:

```
deactivate
```

## 8. Push Changes to GitHub

After making changes, commit and push them in an organized manner.

1. Stage the changes:

   git add .

2. Commit with a descriptive message:

   git commit -m "Your commit message"

3. Push the changes to the main branch:

   git push origin main
